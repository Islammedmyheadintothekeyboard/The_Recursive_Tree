1. When the length is under a certain amount is the base case, and the recursive case of this project is when the length isn't under that certain amount.
2. Trunk and length, length helps to work towards the base case because it decreases each time recursion happens.
3. Figuring out Turtle and how it works, building a v shape without using recursion, and start drawing something with recursion.
